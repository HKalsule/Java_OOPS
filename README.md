# 🧠 Java OOPS Concepts Repository

This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly Java programs designed to demonstrate the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## 📂 Program Descriptions

### 1. 🏛️ `JavaClass.java`
**Concept:** Classes and Objects  
**Description:**  
Introduces basic class creation in Java. Demonstrates how to define a class with attributes (`id`, `name`, `salary`) and methods, and how to create and use objects of that class.

---

### 2. 🆔 `GettersSetters.java`
**Concept:** Encapsulation using Getters and Setters  
**Description:**  
Demonstrates how to protect fields using `private` access and provide controlled access using `public` getter and setter methods.

---

### 3. 🧰 `EmployeeClass.java`
**Concept:** Field Access and Setter Method with Scanner  
**Description:**  
Illustrates how to allow users to input and update object properties at runtime using the `Scanner` class, along with direct field access and method-based printing.

---

### 4. 🛠️ `Constructors.java`  
**Concept:** Constructors  
**Description:**  
Explains the use of constructors to initialize objects with default values. Introduces default (non-parameterized) constructors.

---

### 5. 🔄 `ConstructorOverloading.java`
**Concept:** Constructor Overloading  
**Description:**  
Shows how to define multiple constructors with different parameter lists to provide flexibility when creating object instances.

---

### 6. 🔐 `PriAccModi.java`
**Concept:** Private Access Modifier & Validation  
**Description:**  
Uses `private` fields to implement encapsulation. Includes logic to validate and compare the calculated area and perimeter of a circle with user-provided values.

---

### 7. 📏 `RectangleClass.java`
**Concept:** Area and Perimeter Calculation  
**Description:**  
Implements a simple class for a rectangle with two fields (`length`, `breadth`) and methods to calculate and return area and perimeter.

---

### 8. ⬛ `Square.java`
**Concept:** Square Class with Calculations  
**Description:**  
Defines a class to calculate the area and perimeter of a square using basic formulas with one attribute (`side`).
