## 📚 What This Repo Covers

### 1. 👤 Classes and Objects
**Description:**  
Covers the definition and usage of classes and objects — the foundation of OOP. Includes:
- Class structure
- Object instantiation
- Accessing fields and methods

---

### 2. 🏛️ Inheritance
**Description:**  
Demonstrates how a class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class using the `extends` keyword. Topics include:
- Single inheritance
- Multilevel inheritance
- Use of `super` keyword
- Method overriding

---

### 3. 🌀 Polymorphism
**Description:**  
Shows how a single entity can take many forms. Two types are explored:
- **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):** Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
- **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):** Same method name and signature, but different behavior in child classes.

---

### 4. 🔒 Encapsulation
**Description:**  
Focuses on restricting direct access to class data by:
- Making variables `private`
- Providing `public` getters and setters
- Ensuring data protection and control

---

### 5. 🌫️ Abstraction
**Description:**  
Explains how abstraction hides internal details and only shows essential features. Implemented using:
- **Abstract Classes** (`abstract` keyword)
- **Interfaces**
