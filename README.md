# 🧠 Java OOPS Concepts Repository

This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly Java programs designed to demonstrate the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## 📂 Program Descriptions

### 1. 🏛️ `JavaClass.java`
**Concept:** Classes and Objects  
**Description:**  
Introduces basic class creation in Java. Demonstrates how to define a class with attributes (`id`, `name`, `salary`) and methods, and how to create and use objects of that class.

---

### 2. 🆔 `GettersSetters.java`
**Concept:** Encapsulation using Getters and Setters  
**Description:**  
Demonstrates how to protect fields using `private` access and provide controlled access using `public` getter and setter methods.

---

### 3. 🧰 `EmployeeClass.java`
**Concept:** Field Access and Setter Method with Scanner  
**Description:**  
Illustrates how to allow users to input and update object properties at runtime using the `Scanner` class, along with direct field access and method-based printing.

---

### 4. 🛠️ `Constructors.java`  
**Concept:** Constructors  
**Description:**  
Explains the use of constructors to initialize objects with default values. Introduces default (non-parameterized) constructors.

---

### 5. 🔄 `ConstructorOverloading.java`
**Concept:** Constructor Overloading  
**Description:**  
Shows how to define multiple constructors with different parameter lists to provide flexibility when creating object instances.

---

### 6. 🔐 `PriAccModi.java`
**Concept:** Private Access Modifier & Validation  
**Description:**  
Uses `private` fields to implement encapsulation. Includes logic to validate and compare the calculated area and perimeter of a circle with user-provided values.

---

### 7. 📏 `RectangleClass.java`
**Concept:** Area and Perimeter Calculation  
**Description:**  
Implements a simple class for a rectangle with two fields (`length`, `breadth`) and methods to calculate and return area and perimeter.

---

### 8. ⬛ `Square.java`
**Concept:** Square Class with Calculations  
**Description:**  
Defines a class to calculate the area and perimeter of a square using basic formulas with one attribute (`side`).

---

### 9. 👨‍👦 `Inheritance.java`
**Concept:** Inheritance  
**Description:**  
Demonstrates single inheritance where a child class `age` inherits from a parent class `name`. Also includes usage of inherited methods and fields.

---

### 10. 🏗️ `ConstructorsInInheritance.java`
**Concept:** Constructor Chaining in Inheritance  
**Description:**  
Shows how constructors from base, derived, and child classes are called in hierarchical inheritance. Also demonstrates the use of `super()` to invoke a specific superclass constructor.

---

### 11. 🧪 `prac9.java`
**Concept:** Real-World Class with Multiple Methods  
**Description:**  
Implements a `Cylinder` class with encapsulated radius and height. Includes methods to calculate and display:
- Perimeter of base
- Surface area
- Volume

---

### 12. 🔁 `MethodOverriding.java`
**Concept:** Method Overriding  
**Description:**  
Illustrates runtime polymorphism through method overriding. Class `B` overrides a method from its parent class `A` while adding an extra method of its own.
